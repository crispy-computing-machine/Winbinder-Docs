<h2>What is WinBinder?</h2>
<p>WinBinder is an open source extension to PHP, the script programming language.
It allows PHP programmers to easily build native Windows applications, producing
quick&nbsp;and rewarding results with minimum effort. Even short scripts with a few dozen lines
can generate a useful program, thanks to the power and flexibility of&nbsp;PHP.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> is a very popular scripting language that is used mostly for web
development but is gaining popularity as a general-purpose scripting language.</p>
<p>WinBinder itself is comprised of a DLL (which is the actual PHP extension),
a small set of PHP scripts and some auxiliary files. Of course a minimal
PHP installation is required as well.</p>
