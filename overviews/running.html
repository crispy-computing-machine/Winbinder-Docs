<h2>Running WinBinder</h2>
<h1>Associating the PHPW extension with WinBinder</h1>
<p>To run WinBinder scripts for Windows Explorer, you have to associate .phpw files with php-win.exe.
You can accomplish this in several ways.</p>
<p><b>Option 1.</b> If you use the WinBinder installer, this will be done automatically
for you.</p>
<p><b>Option 2.</b> To manually associate the <b>.phpw</b> extension to php-win.exe:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>In
Explorer, go to Tools - Folder options and select the File Types tab.</li>
    <li>Press New.</li>
    <li>From there, you probably have to browse for the php-win.exe file</li>
    <li>Then
you have the option of always using that program for .phpw files. Check it.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Windows 2000
or Windows XP, you can right-click on the .phpw file and select &quot;Open With...&quot;.&nbsp;In some cases, you might need to hold down Shift for the &quot;Open With...&quot;
to appear.</p>
<p>To associate the phpw extension with WinBinder: In Windows Explorer, go to
Tools / Folder options, then select the File types tab. Click New. This will
open a small dialog. Type phpw, then click OK. A new item will show up on the
list box. The click the Advanced button. This will open a new dialog box. Click
New. Another dialog shows up. In the Action field, type open. In the Application
field, type (or navigate to) the path to php-win.exe, followed by &quot;%1&quot;
(with quotes). Example:</p>
<p>C:\WinBinder\PHP\PHP5\php-win.exe &quot;%1&quot;</p>
<p>Click OK to close the dialog, then OK, then Close. Now you may execute a
PHPW script just by double-clicking it.</p>
<p><b>Option 3.</b> You can also create a FILENAME.REG file to do this for you:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Create
a text file with Notepad or whatever</li>
    <li>Give it a .reg extension</li>
    <li>Place the
following lines in it:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.phpw]<br>@=&quot;phpw_auto_file&quot;<br>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file]<br>@=&quot;PHP Winbinder App&quot;<br>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell]<br>@=&quot;open&quot;<br>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell\open]<br>@=&quot;Run Winbinder App&quot;<br>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell\open\command]<br>@=&quot;\&quot;C:\\PHP\\WinBinder\\PHP\\PHP4\\php-win.exe\&quot; \&quot;%1\&quot;&quot;</code></p>
<p>Be sure to change the line C:\\PHP\\WinBinder\\PHP.... &nbsp;to the path
where you have your php-win.exe. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also take note of the extra \'s...
just like when you have to escape slashes and quotes (a la addslashes()) in
PHP. &nbsp;You only use it on the @=&quot;&quot; bits, not in the parts between
the []'s.</p>
<p>Another note, You see the words &quot;open&quot; appear in there? &nbsp;If
you copy all those lines and change &quot;open&quot; to &quot;edit&quot; or
something you can create a new right-click option for your files.</p>
<p>The @=&quot;open&quot; on the ones ending in \shell needs to match the shell\open
&nbsp;(that is, if you had @=&quot;edit&quot; you'd then need a corresponding
shell\edit)</p>
<p>And the @=&quot;Run Winbinder App&quot; on the shell\open is the text that
appears in the right-click menu for PHPW files.</p>
<p>Example... to add &quot;Edit PHPW With Notepad&quot; you'd add the following
lines to what's already above (at the end probably):</p>
<p><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell\edit]<br>@=&quot;Edit Winbinder App with Notepad&quot;<br>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell\edit\command]<br>@=&quot;%SystemRoot%\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE\&quot; \&quot;%1\&quot;</code></p>
<p>And if you wanted to make this &quot;edit with notepad&quot; the default
double-click action, you'd change the one entry above to be the following:</p>
<p><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\phpw_auto_file\shell]<br>@=&quot;edit&quot;</code></p>
<p>Now you will see &quot;Edit Winbinder App with Notepad&quot; appear in bold
on the right-click menu.</p>
<p>Once you get everything in your .REG file, just double click on it and it'll
ask you if you want to add these lines to your registry.</p>
<p>These changes will happen immediately when you edit the registry with regedit
or will happen as soon as you click &quot;yes&quot; after double-clicking on
the .REG file you created with this stuff in it.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER!!: &nbsp;This alters your registry. &nbsp;If you do it exactly
as I've stated, it won't hurt anything. &nbsp;But if you change it (particularly
the parts between the []'s) it could overwrite important system data (although
it'd take a fluke to hit something critical I think..so the chances are still
relatively low). &nbsp;If this worries you or you're not sure what this is all
about, don't do it. &nbsp;Stick with the OPEN WITH thing on the right-click
or shift-right-click menu. &nbsp;It does effectively the same thing but only
lets you set the default double-click action, not alternate edit/open/etc. actions.</p>
<h1>Running WinBinder without a console (DOS) window</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Use php-win.exe instead of php.exe</li>
    <li>Optionally associate .phpw files with php-win.exe (see above)</li>
    <li>Suppress all your output: no <b>echo()</b>, <b>print()</b>, <b>printf()</b>,
    <b>print_r()</b>&nbsp;etc. in your script. If you do not do that, your script
    may not run at all.</li>
    <li>Suppress errors: use <i>error_reporting = 0</i>&nbsp;in PHP.INI. If
    you do not do that, your script may not run at all with php-win.exe.</li>
    <li>Optionally use <i>display_errors = Off</i>&nbsp;in PHP.INI. If you set
    <i>error_reporting = 0</i> this is not necessary.</li>
</ul>
