<h2>Database support</h2>
<h1><b>Wrapper functions</b></h1>
<p>WinBinder also adds a set of database wrapper functions written in PHP.</p>
<p>These functions are simple wrappers around the SQLite and MySQL functions. They are not meant to replace the database functions, but they do&nbsp;simplify the interaction between these functions and the WinBinder controls.</p>
<p><b><font color="#CC6600"><img src="../images/icon_note.png" align="absmiddle" width="32" height="32" border="0">
NOTE: D</font></b><font color="#CC6600"><b>atabase wrapper functions are available
for SQLite and MySQL only.</b></font></p>
<p>There are 3 levels of abstraction:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Isolate the application from the database in use (here SQLite or MySQL).</li>
    <li>Isolate the application from the unique table names in the database. In some environments (especially when sharing an existing database with other users) the wrapper prefixes a chosen signature (here called APPPREFIX) to table
    names to ensure uniqueness.</li>
    <li>Isolate the application from SQL for table and data manipulation so
    you can access databases even if you are not familiar with SQL.</li>
</ol>
		<p>The database support functions start with the prefix <b>db_</b>.</p>
		<p>For example, to access a record, you just call <b><a href="../functions/db/db_get_data.html">db_get_data</a></b> with the table name,
id number, and column name. Passing NULL  as the id returns an array with the
column values for the whole table, while passing NULL as the column returns
the record pointed by the id. You may also pass an array of ids and columns
and the results will be as expected. This is a very easy and intuitive way of
accessing data. Applications that use this database layer and SQLite are
completely standalone and don't even require a database server, so installation is a snap to the end user.</p>
<p>The functions that access the database directly reside in the db_mysql.inc.php
and db_sqlite.inc.php files. They all have the prefix &quot;raw_db_&quot; as
a reminder that you will have to deal with APPPREFIX, id and SQL by yourself.
Normally you would only use the &quot;db_&quot; functions.</p>
<h1><b>SQL support</b></h1>
		<p>The original functions and SQL commands are available as well and
can be mixed freely with the wrapper library. There are&nbsp;also some wrapper
functions (like<b> </b><a href="../functions/db/db_query.html"><b>db_query</b></a>)
that may be used  to give direct
access to the database using SQL. In this case, the application has to take responsibility for the id field and its attributes as well as any table prefixes.</p>
<p>There are tasks that can nicely be solved with SQL. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the application depends on relations between tables that can not programmed conveniently in PHP, then a SQL
    query will do the job.</li>
    <li>Database administration</li>
    <li>Import and export of tables</li>
</ul>
